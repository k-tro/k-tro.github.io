# My Learning Journal

Hi! I'm documenting my journey to becoming a freelance developer from scratch.  
I update this site every day with what I’ve learned, built, or struggled with.

> 🛤️ My journey into tech didn’t start in a textbook. It began with a setback.  
> Rejected by placements, rebuilding from scratch, I chose to forge my own path — fast.  
> Read the [origin story](daily-logs/Prior_to_23_May_2025.md) and what drives me to learn, build, and earn every single day.
