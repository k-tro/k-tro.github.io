# My Learning/Growth Journal

Hi! I'm documenting my learning journey here.

The plan is quite ambitious: 

#### Doing two ambitious projects:
- [Ray tracing with gravity distortion and postprocessing](https://github.com/k-tro/raytracer)
- [Benchmarking VAEs and their variants across multiple datasets after learning how they work](https://github.com/k-tro/VAE_and_beyond)

#### Doing the archived [CS336 Stanford course](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/)
Repo to be added soon.

#### Applying for jobs and internships

#### Trying ~~not to be late for this~~ to do this in one year less:

The above is what GPT5 suggested to me when I told it what I want to do.
Yes, I have been warned that the GPTs give unrealistic deadlines/timelines/workload. 
But this order doesn't look too bad and I am not devoting my full time to what GPT5 told me.
#### while also doing four Coursera specializations:
- [IBM Data Science Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-fundamentals-python-sql)
- [Meta Full-Stack Developer](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-full-stack-developer)
- [Applied Data Science with Python - Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
- [MLOps - Duke](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mlops-machine-learning-duke)
