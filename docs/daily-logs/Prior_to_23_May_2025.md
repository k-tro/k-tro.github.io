# Before May 23, 2025

Four days ago, I began an intense self-directed journey to rapidly upskill and rebuild my life.

Since then, I’ve completed 3 courses and am halfway through the fourth in the [IBM Java Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/java-developer). My background in C++ and Python made the initial courses smooth. With help from large language models like ChatGPT and Claude, I'm accelerating my learning across many domains.

I’ve set a personal milestone:  
>  **By June 30, 2025, I will start freelancing, no matter where I stand then.**

##  My Story

I graduated in 2025 with a B.Tech in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Bombay. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder during my time there, and it took a toll on my grades (final CPI: 5.4/10). Toward the end, I began scoring A grades again — but it was too late to reverse the damage.

Job opportunities were limited. Many companies never gave me a chance to prove myself. So I made a decision:

> ❝ If doors won't open for me, I’ll build my own. ❞

Freelancing is my chosen path — not just to survive, but to gain real-world experience and earn the freedom to work on my long-term dreams.

## 🛠 Why Coding?

- I had a 10/10 in CS101.  
- I love problem-solving.  
- It’s my **comfort zone** — and a launchpad to bigger things.

Eventually, I will return to aerospace, to math and physics, and to the dream I’ve carried since childhood:  
> To design aircraft and spacecraft of my own.

But for now, I need to stabilize my life. I need income. And I need independence. That’s why I’m learning software development, machine learning, systems programming — and building my skills every single day.

## Current Skill Snapshot

- **Languages**: C++, Python (intermediate), Java (in progress)
- **Problem Solving**: Medium-level DSA on Leetcode; some hard problems too
- **ML**: Training basic MLPs (FreeCodeCamp + Karpathy’s Zero-to-Hero)
- **CS Concepts**: Learning from scratch — fast, but properly

I’m not an expert yet. But I will be.

##  Next 6 Months: The Plan

I’m not just studying randomly. I’ve selected key courses to **maximize practical skill + freelance potential**:

### Topics I’m Speedrunning:
- **Fullstack Java Development**
- **Python, Rust & Embedded C**
- **Cloud: AWS, Azure**
- **Bayesian & Advanced Statistics**
- **ML & MLOps**
- **Operating Systems, Computer Architecture**
- **Open Source, Git, Linux**
- **GPU & Parallel Programming**
- **Cybersecurity Fundamentals**

### Short-Term Goals
- Land my first freelancing gig
- Start logging all daily progress [here](daily-logs/)
- Build real projects & publish them on GitHub
- Start earning to support my parents
- Treat them to dinner with **my own money**

## Final Note

AI will replace a lot of entry-level programming work soon. But I’m not afraid — I plan to **work *with* AI**, not be replaced by it. Machine learning will be part of my aerospace future.

My parents support me for now. I have a roof, internet, food — and time.  
I will use that time well. Learning is free. Growth is hard, but I’m moving forward.

>  “Everything is too basic right now. But it won't be in a few months.”

This page will remain pinned at the top of my website — as a reminder of **where I started**, and why I won’t stop.
